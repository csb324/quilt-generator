# Quilt Making Twitter Bot!

Created with help from the [Generative Twitterbot Starter Project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/generative-twitterbot) on Glitch.

It makes quilts!

The useful files are in the `quilter` directory -- the `generators` folder came with the starter project, and those files have been great to look through for ideas and inspiration. The `public` folder handles the web interface, and I have [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/) hitting the twitter-activating endpoint every hour. 

If you want to make your own, you'll need to add twitter API keys, or just comment out that part in the `server.js` file.

Quilts are math!
